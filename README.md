# Dieaseas-Detection

In this project, we will assume that you work as a consultant and you have been hired by a hospital in downtown Toronto to automate the process of detecting/classifying chest disease. 
The team has collected X-Ray chest data and approached you to develop a model to detect and classify diseases in less than 1 minute. The goal is to reduce the cost and time of detection. 
You have been provided with 133 images that belong to 4 classes: 
Healthy 
Covid-19
Bacterial Pneumonia
Viral Pneumonia
